Raphael Beta is a clinical copilot that combines a conversational LLM with a medical reasoning layer designed for safety, transparency, and interoperability. The system integrates retrieval-augmented generation over curated guidelines (AHA/ACC, ADA, CDC, WHO), deterministic guardrails for dosing and drug–drug interactions, explicit uncertainty estimation with abstention, and SMART-on-FHIR read/write with provenance logging. Multimodal inputs include text, DICOM/JPEG images, and voice; outputs are structured with citations and confidence scores. In simulated FHIR cases shaped by MIMIC-IV schemas and public QA benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MedNLI), Raphael improves factuality and calibration over base LLMs while maintaining practical latency suitable for real-time clinical documentation and decision support. The research prototype emphasizes “assistive, not autonomous” usage, rigorous safety testing, and full auditability. This work aims to restore clinician time, reduce documentation burden, and improve the reliability of AI-supported care through verifiable evidence and conservative decision policies.
