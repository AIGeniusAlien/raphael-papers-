Raphael-Space adapts a clinically validated copilot to astronaut health monitoring under microgravity and communication delay. The system fuses biometric streams (ECG, SpO2, motion), mission log text, and imaging, then constrains recommendations using retrieval from NASA medical operations manuals. We build a simulation environment with domain-shifted physiology and limited bandwidth. A transfer pipeline using synthetic augmentation and domain adaptation improves AUROC for anomaly detection while reducing false alarms and time-to-alert. Safety measures—explicit uncertainty estimates and abstention—mitigate risky outputs when data drift is detected. The results suggest a path toward trustworthy, semi-autonomous health monitoring for exploration-class missions.
