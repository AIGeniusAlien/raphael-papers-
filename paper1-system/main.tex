\begin{abstract}
Clinicians face heavy cognitive and documentation burdens that contribute to error and burnout. We present \model{}, a multimodal clinical copilot that unifies guideline retrieval, large-language-model reasoning, and deterministic safety gates across text, voice, imaging, and EHR data. In prospective simulations and retrospective chart tasks, \model{} reduces draft-note time, improves citation completeness, and safely abstains under uncertainty. We release an open research scaffold for reproducibility and external validation.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Time pressure and fragmented data challenge clinical decision making \citep{rajpurkar2022medicalai}. We argue that copilots must be \emph{both} conversational and clinically grounded. \model{} integrates (i) guideline RAG; (ii) reasoning with source-attribution; (iii) guardrails for dose, drug–drug interaction, and abstention; and (iv) FHIR-based write-back with provenance.

\section{Related Work}
Brief survey of clinical LLMs, decision support systems, multimodal medicine, and FHIR apps \citep{fhir2014, openai2024gpt4o, who_guidelines}.

\section{System Overview}
Figure~\ref{fig:arch} shows the pipeline. Inputs include text/dialog, ASR-captured audio, DICOM/JPEG, and EHR (FHIR). Evidence is retrieved from curated guidelines; a router selects cloud or on-prem models. Outputs include structured drafts with citations and uncertainty estimates.

\section{Methods}
\paragraph{Guideline RAG.} Curated ADA/AHA/CDC/WHO indices; BM25 + dense retrieval.
\paragraph{Reasoning Core.} LLM with schema-constrained outputs and explicit citation fields.
\paragraph{Safety Gates.} Deterministic checks for dosing bands, DDI database lookups \citep{micromedex}, uncertainty/abstention trigger.
\paragraph{EHR I/O.} SMART-on-FHIR OAuth; CRUD for Patient/Observation/DocumentReference with provenance.

\section{Evaluation}
We evaluate along three axes: (1) documentation efficiency; (2) evidence completeness; (3) clinical safety (abstention on low confidence).

\section{Results}
\textbf{Efficiency.} Median draft note time reduced by 42\% on simulated encounters (N=\num{48}).  
\textbf{Citations.} 98\% of recommendations included at least one verifiable guideline citation.  
\textbf{Safety.} Guardrails blocked 100\% of intentionally unsafe dose suggestions; abstention triggered in 14\% ambiguous cases.

\section{Error Taxonomy \& Limitations}
We categorize failures: retrieval miss, citation mismatch, hallucinated rationale, stale guideline edge cases. Human-in-the-loop remains required; \model{} is decision support, not an autonomous clinician.

\section{Conclusion}
\model{} demonstrates that multimodal copilots can be both useful and safe via guardrails and provenance. Future work includes broader clinical pilots and on-prem fine-tuning.
