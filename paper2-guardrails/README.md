We propose a modular safety framework for clinical LLMs comprising four layers: guideline-constrained retrieval, deterministic medication guardrails, uncertainty calibration with abstention, and provenance logging. In the Raphael copilot, the system binds generations to authoritative sources, verifies dose ranges and drug–drug interactions, and attaches confidence scores calibrated via temperature scaling. If uncertainty exceeds a threshold or sources conflict, Raphael abstains and surfaces escalation guidance. We ablate each component across medical QA datasets and simulated patient workflows, showing significant reductions in unsafe outputs and improved expected calibration error with modest latency overhead. The framework is model-agnostic, deployable with or without EHR connectivity, and emphasizes clinician-in-the-loop design. Our results and open artifacts support a repeatable pathway for building safer clinical copilots.
